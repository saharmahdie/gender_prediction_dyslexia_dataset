# SMIDA Documentation

The documentation of SMIDA isn't complete, sometimes outdated and not well structured. There are multiple places to get information.

- The [README](../README.md) gives a general Documentation and tries to explain how to use Docker but is somehow Outdated.
- The [CONTRIBUTE](../CONTRIBUTE.md) file collects information how to contribute.
- The [Markdown Documentation](#Markdown Documentation) is a manual documentation with general principles.
- The [API Documentation](#API Documentation) is a mostly automatic generated documentation with addresses the SMIDA Source Code.
- Furthermore there are some Notes in the [Repository Wiki](https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/cgvr/smida2/schau_mir_in_die_augen/-/wikis/home)

Please help to improve the structure and don't be afraid to contribute at any of the listed places.
